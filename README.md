# CS2303_SouceCode
The whole repository is all about the CS2303
This course introduces students to a model of programming where the programming language exposes details of how the hardware stores and executes software. Building from the design concepts covered in CS 2102, this course covers manual memory management, pointers, the machine stack, and input/ output mechanisms. The course will involve large-scale programming exercises and will be designed to help students confront issues of safe programming with system-level constructs. The course will cover several tools that assist programmers in these tasks. Students will be expected to design, implement, and debug programs in C++ and C.
